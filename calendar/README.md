## Features

- Month and year selection dropdowns
- Dynamic rendering of calendar days
- Highlighting of selected date
- "Today" button for quick navigation to the current date
- Support for leap years
- Modular and object-oriented design

## Key Takeaways for Developers

1. **Date Manipulation**: The project demonstrates various techniques for working with dates in JavaScript, including getting the number of days in a month, determining the day of the week for the first day of a month, and handling leap years.

2. **Modular Architecture**: The calendar is structured into separate modules (Calendar.js, Month.js, data.js, utils.js) promoting code organization and reusability.

3. **Class-based Component Design**: The use of classes (Calendar and Month) showcases how to create reusable and encapsulated components in vanilla JavaScript.

4. **DOM Manipulation**: Various techniques for DOM manipulation are demonstrated, including creating elements dynamically, updating the calendar grid, and handling user interactions.

5. **Event Handling**: The project illustrates how to handle user interactions through event listeners, such as date selection, month/year changes, and the "Today" button click.

6. **Data Management**: The use of separate data files (data.js) for storing constants and mappings shows how to manage application data efficiently.

7. **Utility Functions**: The project includes utility functions (utils.js) that encapsulate common operations, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

8. **Responsive Design**: The calendar layout uses CSS Grid for a flexible and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

9. **Customization**: The component allows for easy customization of styles and behaviors, making it adaptable for various project requirements.

This calendar component provides a solid foundation for date-related functionalities in web applications, demonstrating best practices in JavaScript development and UI component design.
